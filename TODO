- loading of datasets in table format  DONE
- optimize search for exact serching (no heap) DONE
- build several randomized kmeans (with different branching factors - might help for the branching factors to be prime numbers) DONE - didn't help
- improve build system DONE
- automatically tuned parameters DONE
- port to tango library DONE




- add memory usage to the parameters autotune algorithm

- speedup heap operations by using a smaller double-ended heap: http://www.diku.dk/forskning/performance-engineering/Jesper/heaplab/heapsurvey_html/node11.html#SECTION00400000000000000000

- documentation for the program

- a better autotune parameters algorithm





- fix write performance for dat files

- profiling and optimization (GPU?, BLAS?, BLADE?, NVIDIA CUDA library for GPU optimized computations)

- speedup kmeans using sampling or kdtree ( make sense only for very large branching factor... not sure if the case)









- mean shift clustering

idea: - a kd-tree like structure but each time the split direction should not be a dimension, but the perpendicular on the direction with highest variance
