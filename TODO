- loading of datasets in table format  DONE

- optimize search for exact serching (no heap) DONE

- build several randomized kmeans (with different branching factors - might help for the branching factors to be prime numbers) DONE

- improve build system DONE



- profiling and optimization (GPU?, BLAS?)
- checkout NVIDIA CUDA library for GPU optimized computations

- speedup kmeans using sampling

- mean shift clustering

- port to tango library



idea: - a kd-tree like structure but each time the split direction should not be a dimension, but the perpendicular on the direction with highest variance
